### Modern times

"Modern Times" generally refers to a **1936** silent film directed and starring **Charlie Chaplin**. The film satirically describes the **impact of industrial society and economic difficulties on people**. The protagonist of the movie is Chaplin's famous "Little Wanderer" character, and throughout the movie he works in a large factory, is once jailed, befriends a girl, and has a series of other adventures.

"Modern Times" is known for its social and political commentary on Chaplin. The film showcases the horrors of modern industry and "progress", while also celebrating people's ability to find hope, joy and humanity even under these circumstances.

Also, "Modern Times" has the feature of being the first movie in which we hear Charlie Chaplin's own voice in the cinema. But instead of colloquial language in the film, Chaplin uses meaningless words and sounds while singing a song, which he considers a "silent film" that did not fully complete the transition from the silent film era to the sound film era. This situation gives the film a symbolic meaning in terms of social criticism of the industrial age.

### Which is/is not the definition of modernity?

Modernity in sociology refers to the time period or era of humanity that was defined by scientific, technological, and socioeconomic changes that started in Europe.

#### Feudalism vs Modernity

**Feudalism** is a socio-economic system that prevailed in Europe, usually in the Middle Ages. This system was based on landed property and a lord-colonial relationship that offered protection in return for service. Overlords relied on a servant class of peasants, farmers or serfs to defend their property and wealth. During this period, society had a strict hierarchy and mobility was often limited. Under the feudal system, the economy was largely based on agriculture, and science and technology developments were generally slow.

**Modernity**, on the other hand, represents a period that emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries after the industrial revolution. During this period, feudalism was replaced by capitalism and this led to significant changes in the way of life of the people. The industrial revolution represented a major change in production methods and this resulted in massive migrations to the cities and rapid population growth. During this period, there were great advances in science and technology, and the education level of the people generally rose. In the modern era, democracy and individual rights often replace the hierarchical and community-centered structure of feudalism.

### The important thinkers of the Enlightenment period generally include:

* **Voltaire (François-Marie Arouet)** - Voltaire was one of the leading advocates of Enlightenment values, encouraging discussions on religious tolerance and free thought.

* **Jean-Jacques Rousseau** - He is known for his theories on the social contract and the general will. He also wrote about natural rights and education.

* **John Locke** - Locke was one of the founders of empiricism, focusing on experience. He discussed natural rights and the establishment of government.

* **Immanuel Kant** - Kant was a philosopher and Enlightenment thinker who had profound effects on epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics. He defined the Enlightenment as a process representing the courage to use one's own reason.

* **Adam Smith** - Considered the father of modern economic theory, Smith put forth substantial theories on free market capitalism.

* **Denis Diderot** - Diderot was an important thinker of the Enlightenment period, known for his work "Encyclopédie." This work aimed to bring together the scientific and philosophical knowledge of the time in a comprehensive encyclopedia.

* **David Hume** - Hume, an important figure of the Scottish Enlightenment, wrote on morality, metaphysics, epistemology, and religious criticism.

**Montesquieu (Charles-Louis de Secondat)** - Montesquieu was one of the most significant thinkers advocating for the separation of powers in government.


### Enlightened despotism

* The Period of Enlightenment: **17th and 18th** century

Enlightened despotism, also known as enlightened absolutism, is a form of government where the ruler has absolute power, but they use this power for the benefit of the people in a progressive manner. They try to apply principles of the Enlightenment, like reason, science, and human rights, into their rule. Famous enlightened despots include Frederick the Great of Prussia, Catherine the Great of Russia, and Joseph II of Austria. They made reforms like improved education, religious tolerance, and better justice systems, but still kept all political power to themselves.

### What are/are not the consequences of the industrial revolution? 

The Industrial Revolution was a period from the **18th to the 19th** century where major changes in **agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transport, and technology** had a profound effect on the socio-economic and cultural conditions of the times.

Here are some of the results of the Industrial Revolution:

* **Economic Growth:** The Industrial Revolution led to unprecedented economic growth in Western countries. There was an increase in wealth and living standards.
* **Urbanization:** Many people moved from rural areas to cities for work, leading to the growth of cities. This is called urbanization.
* **Technological Advancements:** The Industrial Revolution brought about many technological advancements. This included the development of steam engines, railroads, and factories.
* **Employment Opportunities:** New industries created a variety of jobs. However, working conditions were often poor and dangerous.
* **Changes in Society:** There were significant societal changes. The middle class grew, and there was a shift from an agricultural society to an industrial one.


The difference between **Feudalism** and the **Industrial Revolution** is significant. In feudalism, people generally served the person who owned the land. It was a system focused on **land, agriculture, and livestock**. With the Industrial Revolution, people began to work as factory workers and adapt to city life, which led to the **secularization of society and the economy**.

The feudal system is a system where one's social and economic status usually comes by birth. However, with the Industrial Revolution, a person's status became more tied to their work capacity and skills. This marked the end of feudalism and the beginning of the transition to a capitalist economy.



### Karl Marx conflict of interest

* Where there is exploitation there is conflict.

Karl Marx is a thinker who talks about class conflict. He says there is a **fight between two groups**. These groups are the "rich people," who own things like factories, and the "workers," who work in these factories for money.

Marx says that the rich people use the workers to make more money. They do this by not paying the workers enough. This makes the workers unhappy and causes a conflict, or fight, between the two groups. Marx thinks that one day, the workers will fight back against the rich people to create a fair society.

### Social and Economic Stratification

#### WHAT ARE 4 IMPORTANT SOCIAL STRUCTURES?
* Caste system (you can't change your rank)
* Matriarchal system
* Estate system
* Class system (you can change)

Social and economic stratification is the division of people into certain classes or groups in society. This stratification is usually based on the economic resources, social status and power people have. If we look at the two main systems of stratification, they are the "caste" (caste) and "class" (class) systems.

The caste system is commonly seen in India and is a system where people stay in the group they were born in. This is generally unchanged and social mobility is very limited. The caste system refers to social and occupational status, usually determined by birth.

On the other hand, the class system is more flexible and often based on the economic situation. People have the opportunity to rise or fall through education, talent, and effort. Class system refers to people's status in society, wealth, education and jobs.

As a result, the caste system is usually determined and unchangeable at birth, while the class system is more flexible and relies on economic and personal effort. These two systems deal with social and economic stratification in different ways.

### What is secularization and the three aspects of secularization

Secularization is a process where the role of religion becomes less important in society. It focuses more on worldly things rather than spiritual matters. People start caring more about materialistic things and less about life after death.

Three parts of secularization can be:

* People's religious beliefs and practices decrease.
* Separation happens between religious institutions and secular parts of society, like the government and church become separate.
* Religion becomes a more private matter, less involved in public life.

### Nation State 

A "nation state" is a country. It is a place where people live together under a government. In the past, if people had a legal problem, they might fight or duel in the street. This was during the time of feudalism.

But in a nation state, only the government can use violence or force. This is called the "monopoly of violence." This means that only the state can legally use physical force against its citizens. It is a key part of keeping peace and order.

The "territorial borders" of a nation state are very important. They mark where one country ends and another begins. You must have permission from the government to cross these borders. This shows respect for the country's laws and its people.

Finally, a nation state has a central structure or organization. This is called the government. The government makes and enforces the rules for everyone in the country. It works to keep everyone safe and to help the country succeed.


### Fundamentalism

"Fundamentalism" means following a religion or idea in a strict way. It is often against modern or liberal values.

"Religious conflicts" happen between different religious groups. They can be about beliefs or practices and sometimes involve violence.

"Religious movements" represent different ways of understanding or practicing a religion. They can differ in how they interpret religious texts, practice rituals, or view religious authority.

### Karl Marx vs Max Weber

Karl Marx believed that societies are shaped by conflicts between classes. For Marx, change in societies often happens because of fights between workers and capitalists. **(economy is important)** **(Das Kapital, Communist Manifesto)**

Max Weber thought that while social classes and economic fights are important, they alone can't explain how societies change. According to Weber, other cultural things like religious beliefs and values are also important. **(ideas are important)** **(Protestan Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism)**

## Classic

### NATION-STATE

A nation-state is a political entity characterized by the combination of a nation and a state. The term refers to a sovereign state that consists of a specific group of people who share a common culture, history, language, or ethnicity, and are united under a centralized government. In a nation-state, the population identifies themselves as part of a distinct nation and usually seeks to maintain their cultural, linguistic, and historical heritage.

The concept of a nation-state emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries with the rise of nationalism, which emphasized the idea that a nation should have its own independent political organization. Prior to that, political entities were often formed based on various factors such as monarchies, city-states, or empires, which did not necessarily correspond to a specific nation.

## GLOBALIZATION

Globalization refers to the interconnectedness, integration, and interdependence of economies, societies, cultures, and governance systems across national borders. It is a multifaceted process characterized by the increased flow of goods, services, capital, information, ideas, and people across nations, facilitated by advancements in technology, transportation, and communication.

Specifically, globalization encompasses the following dimensions:

Economic Globalization: This aspect relates to the growing interconnectedness of national economies through trade, investment, and financial flows.

Overall, globalization represents a complex and multifaceted process that transcends national boundaries, shaping and influencing various aspects of human interaction, economic activity, cultural exchange, and political dynamics on a global scale.

## LIBERAL DEMOCRACY

A liberal democracy is a form of government characterized by the principles of liberalism and democracy. It is a political system that combines the protection of individual rights and freedoms with representative democracy, the rule of law, and the respect for pluralism.

Specifically, a liberal democracy entails the following elements:

Individual Rights and Freedoms: Liberal democracies uphold and protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, such as freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and the right to privacy. These rights are typically enshrined in a constitution or a bill of rights and are safeguarded by independent judiciary.

Rule of Law: Liberal democracies are governed by the rule of law, where laws apply equally to all citizens, including government officials. The rule of law ensures that the government acts within legal boundaries, promotes accountability, and protects individuals from arbitrary exercise of power.

Representative Democracy: Liberal democracies feature representative institutions where citizens elect their representatives through free and fair elections. These representatives form the government and are accountable to the people. Regular elections, political parties, and a pluralistic electoral system are key components of representative democracy.

Pluralism and Tolerance: Liberal democracies embrace pluralism, allowing diverse viewpoints, beliefs, and interests to coexist. They respect and protect minority rights and promote tolerance, inclusivity, and peaceful coexistence of different religious, ethnic, and cultural groups.

Checks and Balances: Liberal democracies have a system of checks and balances to prevent the concentration of power. This includes the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, ensuring that no single institution or individual can dominate decision-making.

Civil Society and Freedom of Association: Liberal democracies support the existence of a vibrant civil society, which includes non-governmental organizations, advocacy groups, and independent media. Freedom of association allows individuals to form and join organizations to express their interests, concerns, and opinions.

Protection of Property Rights and Market Economy: Liberal democracies generally support private property rights and promote market-based economies with a framework of regulations. They encourage economic freedom, competition, and entrepreneurship while providing a safety net for vulnerable members of society.

These elements collectively define a liberal democracy, where individual rights, democratic governance, rule of law, and respect for diversity are the guiding principles of the political system.

External sovereignty refers to a state's independence in relation to other nations, allowing it to engage in international relations, negotiate treaties, and participate in global affairs.

Equality among States: The principle of sovereignty emphasizes the equality of states in the international system. Each sovereign state is regarded as having an equal status and rights to self-determination, regardless of its size, population, or political structure.

Inalienability: Sovereignty is generally considered an inherent and inalienable right of states. While states may choose to enter into international agreements or delegate specific powers to supranational bodies, the core authority and decision-making capabilities remain with the sovereign entity.

Overall, sovereignty represents the supreme and independent authority of a state or governing body over a defined territory, encompassing both internal governance and external relations. It signifies the autonomy and self-determination of a political entity within the framework of the international system.
